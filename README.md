# AirBnB Tests Playwright & Pytest

## Description
This project involves automating test cases for the Airbnb website using Playwright for browser automation, pytest for test framework management, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to maintain clean and reusable test code.

The project focuses on two key test cases that simulate searching for apartments, analyzing results, and interacting with the reservation process on the Airbnb platform.
